      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The year was 1978.
        Amable R. Aguiluz V., fourth son and namesake of Amable M. Aguiluz
        (1913-1977) who was former auditor general during the Macapagal
        administration, formed a distributorship in Manila for Computerland. The
        firm because one of the main distributor of Apple Computer in the
        Philippines. It became one of the venues by which advancement made in
        the computer science and technology were absorbed in the Philippines
        industrial life. The computer boom originating in Silicon Valley
        manifested itself in this undertaking.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In the Philippines, as
        in other parts of the world, the trend is towards computerization.
        However, the object conditions of the national economy are still not
        totally suitable to this modern technology. The distributor’s motive
        is therefore to ensure an increasing rate of demand for computers. The
        formula was simple: train programmers for wider distribution base. On
        October 22, 1980, The Amable M. Aquiluz Institute of Computer Studies (AMAICS)
        was established for said purpose.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It cannot be denied the
        Institute was initially conceived to bolster the marketing effort of
        Computerland. The education component was incidental to the main
        undertaking of distributorship. AMAICS was housed at the second floor of
        David building along Shaw Boulevard . Six apple computer were initially
        used and eight trainees were taken in its short term EDP courses</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The courses increased
        awareness of the application of computer technology in every aspect of
        human endeavor. The outcome has already ensured a steady demand for
        computer. However, computer awareness was not enough. What started as
        independent concern. Why train more programmers when there is a need to
        lay the foundation for the indigenous computer science development? The
        business venture must take a separate working agenda has started.</font><font size="1" color="#ffffff" face="Tahoma">
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Six months after its
        inception, AMAICS started offering the Comprehensive Bachelor of Science
        in Computer Science Program. In this semester, the institutes has a
        total of thirteen enrollees. It occupied the old site with the very same
        number of computer. With a very shall faculty and enrollment, history
        was drafted: AMAICS became the first institution of learning to offer a
        comprehensive curriculum for the country’s future computer scientist.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Student population
        continuously rose from a pioneering batch of 13 students over 10,000
        student by school year 1992-1993. As enrollment increase, AMAICS was
        renamed by its Board of Trustees as AMA COMPUTER COLLEGE. This
        necessitate the expansion of its physical plants. To date in addition to
        the Makati and Quezon City Campuses, the institution has other campuses
        in the provinces of Cebu and Davao. In keeping with its global mission,
        the institution has opened tweo international in Guam and Bangladesh.
        The Quezon City Campus has its own sport facilities and a computer
        center which houses the latest – state – of the art equipment. The
        said campus also house the elementary and high school departments.
        Immediate in the program of action of the institution is the attainment
        of full university status by the year 1995.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">With the inking of an
        agreement with the prestigious American League of College and
        Universities (ALOCU) that has more than 30 affiliate member schools all
        over the United States, the forward movement continues. AMA Computer
        College is also an affiliate of the Philippines Computer Society, the
        Philippines Association for Computer Educators, the Philippines
        Association for Computer Educators, the Association of Philippines
        College of Arts and Sciences, Philippines Chamber of Commerce and
        Industry, John F. Kennedy – Japan Campus and the US Chamber of
        Commerce.</font></p>
